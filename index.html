            <p>
                Vocaloid is a singing synthesizer software that allows users to create music featuring voices that sound like human singers.
                
                Developed by Yamaha Corporation, it has gained immense popularity worldwide, especially among music producers and fans of Japanese pop culture.
                
                By using a combination of text-to-speech technology and a vast library of vocal samples, Vocaloid enables users to create original songs with a wide range of vocal styles and tones.
                From energetic pop anthems to soothing ballads, the possibilities are virtually endless. 
                Vocaloid has also spawned a thriving community of fans and creators who share their music, collaborate on projects, and even develop their own Vocaloid characters. This vibrant ecosystem has contributed to the software's enduring popularity and cultural impact.

                    A VOCALOID "vocalist", "character", or "mascot" (unofficial terminology)[1] refers heavily to an illustrated character of a VOCALOID™-powered voice bank, although a product name or miscellaneous representation (like an avatar) can be included.

                <p>
                    In order for a product to be classified as a "VOCALOID", there should be acknowledgment by the YAMAHA Corporation under their licensing terms and there is a VOCALOID™-powered vocal in development or fully released. This includes characters from games with vocals powered by the VOCALOID™ software, as well as privatized vocals.

It can be noted that fanmade Derivatives and other synthesizer characters such as UTAU are not classified as "VOCALOIDs".
